**Ultra-high Resolution Image Understanding** <br /><br />
<span style="font-size:15px;">Understanding ultra-high resolution images (i.e., >2K) is a challenging problem due to high computational burden, which can benefit the fields of remote sensing or medical imaging. The goal is to strike the balance between effectiveness and efficiency. Ultimately, we hope we can accomplish the real-time processing for ultra-high resolution images.</span><br>
